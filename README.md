# experiments-rabbitmq
My personal RabbitMQ examples and experiments in Java, while reading the Python centric book [RabbitMQ In Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/rabbitmq-in-depth).

The RabbitMQ server can be easily installed as a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq).
Use the docker tag ```3-management``` to install RabbitMQ including the management UI.
